Right now the assignment generator assumes that the student numbers are stored in a file called "STUDENT_NUMBERS".

Much apologies: as of yet only A1 and A2 generation is implemented. A3 coming soon! Newest versions can be found at https://github.come/dukebw/AST_PrettyPrinter.

To install Boost (on Unix): 
Option 1: Use your package manager (version of Boost may be slightly old).

Option 2: get boost_1_56_0.tar.bz2 from www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_56_0.html.

Then go to the directory where you want the Boost installation and execute tar --bzip2 -xf /path/to/boost_1_56_0.tar.bz2 (for example, /usr/local/boost_1_56_0.tar.bz2).

From the boost_1_56_0 directory, type ./bootstrap.sh --with-libraries=filesystem --with-libraries=system, then type ./b2 install. Alternatively, as I did, simply type ./bootstrap.sh then ./b2 install to do a full install. Reference: www.boost.org/docs/libs/1_56_0/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html.

Next you will have to add the directory $BOOST_HOME/boost_1_56_0/stage/lib/ to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable, where $BOOST_HOME is wherever Boost was installed (/usr/local/ for example).

Potentially you may have to add $BOOST_HOME or $BOOST_HOME/boost_1_56_0 to your $PATH variable; it appears that I didn't have to. Note that to link the boost::filesystem and boost::system libraries, -lboost_filesystem and -lboost_system have to be added to the compile command (e.g. g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test -lboost_filesystem -lboost_system).

This is a first incarnation of an AST that is ultimately supposed to represent a single function with return type int within a class. 

The function will be an if-else construct in the cases of A1.java and A2.java, and a for loop representing a recurrence relation in the case of A3.java

Many of the comments are as much for my own clarification as for other potential readers of my program.

At this point I realize that by having get() functions that return pointers to my private data members I ruin the encapsulation of the program. In future versions I hope to devise a way to not return pointers to the data members, or to find some way to make the program safer.

Currently indents are implemented with tabs. It may be preferable to switch this with two spaces (which can be done by changing one line in JavaPrinter::printIndents()).
