This is a first incarnation of an AST that is ultimately supposed to represent a single function with return type int within a class. 

The function will be an if-else construct in the cases of A1.java and A2.java, and a for loop representing a recurrence relation in the case of A3.java

Many of the comments are as much for my own clarification as for other potential readers of my program.

At this point I realize that by having get() functions that return pointers to my private data members I ruin the encapsulation of the program. In future versions I hope to devise a way to not return pointers to the data members, or to find some way to make the program safer.

Currently indents are implemented with tabs. It may be preferable to switch this with two spaces (which can be done by changing one line in JavaPrinter::printIndents()).
